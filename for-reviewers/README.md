This directory provides the template for an SC25 Reproducibility report.

There are some TODOs, and in the content of the report, replace the
instructions of what should be described in the given section with
the actual description.

The report can be used in two scenarios:
- if the reviewer is fine with disclosure of identity, nothing to do
- if the reviewer does want to keep the identity hidden, add the
  "nonacm" option to the documentclass to prohibit author blob etc,
  and uncomment the line "\setboolean{standalone}{false}"
